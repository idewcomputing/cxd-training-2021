# Choosing a Programming Workshop

### Choose from six workshops specifically focused on the tasks of programming and building.

Intended for teachers planning a semester or full-year CS course in grades 6-12, these six workshops will run concurrently for one week at the beginning of June in 2021. **If you intend to teach a full year course, we recommend you choose two technology workshops.** 

The online workshops will be largely conducted asynchronously with two live meetings scheduled.  Material and videos will be available after the workshops for self-guided learning.
