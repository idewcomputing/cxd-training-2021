# Workshop Deliverables

For the programming workshops we simply request that you submit the following two items.

1. **A link to your working code \(e.g. replit.com\) that demonstrates completion and customization of tutorial material.**
2. **A summary of your classroom plan**

   * **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.** 
     * What will be your expectations? 
     * How much will be individual work versus team work?
     * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?

 

   * **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
     * Will you use any online tutorials?
     * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
     * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
