## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.** 
  * What will be your expectations? 
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?

If you are participating in the [Innovation Workshop](../../cxd-innovation-workshop/full-experience.md) you will consider similar questions for broader project activities.
