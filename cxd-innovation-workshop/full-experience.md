### Prepare for a full-semester PBL experience in computer science engaging the breadth of work in building a product using design, data, and programming.

The Computing by Design Innovation Workshop will cover the development of computer science projects through a three-phase process that goes from researching a problem, building a solution, and evaluating the solution. The project framework and prepared material will provide the guidance needed to plan a semester experience regardless of which technology the project employs. The online workshops will be largely conducted asynchronously with two live meetings scheduled.
