# Workshop Deliverable

**In this workshop we want to provide the resources and help you need to prepare a classroom plan for teaching computer science in the coming year.**

### A Few Notes:

* **While your plan may not be complete** and require more development this summer, provide enough detail to express the key elements of your plan that enables some discussion with others.
* **We understand that you may choose to use other CS material** at varying degrees with the CxD material or another PBL experience to fit your students' needs. Please share that as part of your plan, as it doesn't need to be solely based on CxD material.
* **Even if you are not offering a CS course this fall**, please post an outline of how you might facilitate a class in the future.

### Sharing Your Plan on Slack

By sharing your semester plan for teaching a CS course with other workshop participants in Slack you can get valuable feedback -- and provide others feedback as well. 

### Templates and Resources

Whether you are intending to run a single project as the main activity for a semester or inject a smaller project within another instructional context, you can use [**this template**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-VrDuWMlp4r6uCqIF1fx5NQlTjsBa_4TErhwKJYejc/edit?usp=sharing) as a starting point. You may also want to use \(or borrow ideas from\) the ****[**PBLWorks project planner**](https://my.pblworks.org/planner)**.**

If you are going to use a CxD project guidebook, a lot of the details are already prepared, but you definitely want to formulate the big-picture plan on you will facilitate the course in your context. Ultimately, make the project/course plan work for you and include the level of detail you need. We hope these resources are good starting points.
