# ✻ Short Projects for Any Class

### Whether you teach math, language arts, history, or computer science – prepare for a short project that intersects computer science with any discipline.

Choose one \(or more\) of six workshops that introduce you to short projects of approximately 10-15 student hours. Each workshop will be offered July 12 - 16. These workshops allow 1\) CS teachers that are already skilled in one area of CS to supplement their PBL/CS proficiencies, or 2\) non-CS teachers a meaningful way to inject a small CS project into their class.
