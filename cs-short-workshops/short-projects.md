# ✻ Short Projects for Any Class

### Whether you teach math, language arts, history, or computer science – prepare for a short project that intersects computer science with any discipline.

Choose one \(or more\) of six workshops that introduce you to short projects of approximately 10-15 student hours. Each workshop will be offered July 12 - 16. These workshops allow 1\) CS teachers that are already skilled in one area of CS to supplement their PBL/CS proficiencies, or 2\) non-CS teachers a meaningful way to inject a small CS project into their class.

| Workshop | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proposing Solutions in Computing Workshop** | Students investigate a problem, defining the key stakeholders and identifying the opportunities for improvement with computing technologies. Students will then generate proposals for presentation. |
| **Sketching and Prototyping in Computing Workshop** | Students envision a new mobile application through sketches and generate a dynamic prototype \(without coding\) to evaluate their idea. |
| **Product Evaluation in Computing Workshop** | Students conduct a careful study of an existing computer/phone product for usability and user experience. Students will synthesize a report or presentation to share their findings and recommendations. |
| **CS for Math & Science: Charting Data** | Students process and prepare data for visualization with a combination of spreadsheets and graphics software. |
| **CS for Language Arts: Use Machine Learning to Analyze Writing** | Students experiment with _natural language processing_ techniques to analyze writing and evaluate the value and risk it brings. |
| **Build a Flip Card App Study Guide for Any Course** | Students input course content for a flip card application and then style it for a fun and engaging experience. **** |
